# to-do-list
03-20-2024: This is attempt 11 at creating this to do list project. I have duplicated a repo after my 2nd repo (attempts 6-10) would not revert due to webpack involvement. I hope to be free from this Sisyphys Rock soon. 

A local storage-enabled To Do project organizer built using Webpack framework &amp; JSON.

<p>To Do:</p>
<ul>
    ~~<li>Make Tasklist Show on Page USING SOLID PRINCIPLES</li>~~
    <li>Make Single Tasklist & Project Tasklist WORK TOGETHER...</li>
    <li>Make DisplayTask use the array.[item] instead of whatever it is now</li>
</ul>

<p>Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25436312/gitignore-not-working Ahmad for .gitignore help
<p>1/21/2024, 9:53PM: Did you know, Webpack does not allow functions to run in the console? <em>My disappointment is immeasurable and my evening is ruined.</em> I spent 1.5 or 2 hours trying to get my console to accept new input.</p>
